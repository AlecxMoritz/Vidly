Understanding The Problem

Before you start to code at all, you have to know exactly what problem you are trying to solve.

And you need to know HOW that will be happening
		or you 'inputs and outputs'
		What data are you taking in, and what are you sending back



Technically, there nothing wrong with starting on the front end or the back end, however, starting on the front end can lead to complex designs,
	and those design bleeding into the back end, and you could end up over-engineering
