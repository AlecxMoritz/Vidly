Overriding Conventions in Code First workflow

Entity Framework has some default convetions
Like a string is nullable and has no character limit, 
so in out Customers table, our Name property has no limit
Which in the real end-tier world, can be problematic


So we can use keywords defined in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace to help

public class Customer
    {
        [Key]
        public int Id { get; set; }
		[Required] // << -- make something nonnullable
		[StringLength(255)] // << -- set the max length
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public bool IsSubscribedToNewsletter { get; set; }
        public MembershipType MembershipType { get; set; }
        public byte MembershipTypeId { get; set; }

    }
