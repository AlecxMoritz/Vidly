Eager Loading

By default Entity Framework does not load related objects, so we need to tell it to

public ActionResult Index()
        {										// this is the Include() which we can use to include an objects related types, 
												// here the c represents our table
            var customers = _context.Customers.Include(c => c.MembershipType).ToList();

            CustomersViewModel viewModel = new CustomersViewModel
            {
                Customers = customers
            };

            return View(viewModel);
        }
