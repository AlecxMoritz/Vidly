Seeding Databases in Code First

We can do this with migrations

First add a migration,
Then inside the migration file

public override void Up()
        {
            Sql("INSERT INTO MembershipTypes (Id, SignUpFee, DurationInMonths, DiscountRate) VALUES (1, 0, 0, 0)");
            Sql("INSERT INTO MembershipTypes (Id, SignUpFee, DurationInMonths, DiscountRate) VALUES (2, 30, 1, 10)");
            Sql("INSERT INTO MembershipTypes (Id, SignUpFee, DurationInMonths, DiscountRate) VALUES (3, 90, 3, 15)");
            Sql("INSERT INTO MembershipTypes (Id, SignUpFee, DurationInMonths, DiscountRate) VALUES (4, 300, 12, 20)");

        }

We can use the Sql() method to write SQL statements to be executed during the migration
