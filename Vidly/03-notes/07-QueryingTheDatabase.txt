Querying the Database

In the end-tier world, no one hard codes their data

They get their data from a database, API, or somewhere else

The first thing you need when querying the db is a connection, or gateway to the db
By convention we declare it like this

private ApplicationDbContext context;

And we have to initialize it in our constructor, and create a way to dispose of it

public CustomerController()
{
	_context = new ApplicationDbContext;
}

public override void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
	_context.Dispose();
}

Then we can access the data in out database with the . operator

_context.Customers << -- returns the Customers in the database

// another note is that [ var customers = _context.Customers;] does not immediately run the query, the query is instead executed when 
 [customers] would be iterated over

// a way around this however is to call a method on the _context
Ex:

	var customers = _context.Customers.ToList();
