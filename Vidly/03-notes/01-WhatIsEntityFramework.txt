Entity Framework is a ORM for working with a Database
Like Sequelize is to JavaScript, Entity is to ASP.NET

It maps data in our database to objects in our application

Entity Framework provides a class called DbContext that is a gateway to our database
A DbContext has one or more DbSet(s) which represent tables in our database

We use LINQ to query the DbSets, which is translated to SQL at runtime

When we use Entity Framework, it will keep track of data, and when we ask it to, it will generate SQL statements and execute them on our database
