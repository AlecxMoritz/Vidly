Migrations in Code First Entity Framework

Whenever we add another DbSet, or change it, or make any change to our db, we're going to have to run a migration

NuGet Package Manager Console is where we will manage our migrations
	- note it is not case sensitive

Before you get started with migrations you have to enable them:
PM> enable-migrations

The you add the migrations
PM> add-migration [migrationName]



//

you can use 'cls' to clear the console screen
PM> cls


the -force switch - used for overwriting a migration
PM> add-migration [alreadyExistingMigration] -force
