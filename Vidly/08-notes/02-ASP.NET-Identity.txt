ASP.NET Identity

ASP.NET Identity originated as ASP.NET Membership, however there were several issues and over the years it was improved and
rebranded into ASP.NET Identity

Identity comes with multile domain classes and simple APIs to work with these classes

The APIs consist of UserManager, RoleManager, SignInManager, and so on and so forth
And they talk internally to another group of classes like UserStore and RoleStore, which represent the persistence store of ASP.NET Identity

Identity provides an implementation using Entity Framework and a relational SQL database
