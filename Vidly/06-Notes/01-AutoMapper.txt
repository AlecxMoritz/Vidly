AutoMapper to install AutoMapper

inside the Nuget Package Manager
run 

install-package automapper --verion:4.1

this is the one you've worked with

you then need to create a mapping profile, which will be a class in App_Start

public MappingProfile()
        {
            Mapper.CreateMap<Customer, CustomerDto>();
            Mapper.CreateMap<CustomerDto, Customer>();
        }


Then inside the Global.asax.cs file need to get it started

 Mapper.Initialize(c => c.AddProfile<MappingProfile>());

Then you can use automapper to map objects to objects of different types.
Automapper is a CONVENTION based mapper,
so it looks for properties of the same name and maps the values to each other.
