By default the webAPI is going to send the response back with PascallCasing,
which isnt awful except that our JSON responses are going to be used in JavaScript programming, 
and because JavaScript uses camelCasing, it going to make our code look ugly.

inside the WebAPI.config file

var settings = config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings;

            settings.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
            settings.Formatting = Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented;

	You would need to change these settings
	and WHAM camelCasing JSONs
