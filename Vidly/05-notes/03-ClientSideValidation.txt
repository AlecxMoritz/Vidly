ASP.NET Ships with jQuery client side validation, which will make sure the data is in the right format
before sending the request.

Enabling it is simple

@section scripts
{
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")

}

Underneath the end of your .cshtml file

Now there will not be a request made unless the data is in the correct format
for the server/db to process the request
