AntiForgery Tokens combat CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery

This is a hacker tactice.
In practice they would lead a user(who still has their token saved in local storage),
away from a website, and on the new page have an tiny iframe with a bit of javascript code in it,
and in the that code, they can send a request using the victim's token.
They could execute any code on that on behalf of the victim, and leave no ip address to chase as they come from the victim's own browser.

This is Cross-Site Request Forgery

So at the end of our forms we use
 @Html.AntiForgeryToken();
