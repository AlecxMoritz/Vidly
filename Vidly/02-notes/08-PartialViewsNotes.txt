Partial views are ways to break large views out into smaller resuable chunks

By convention, they are named with an underscore prefix
_NavBar


Make sure you check the 'create as partial' when creating partials, as we don't want them to have a layout

Partials are just average old razor and c# thats called through the Html helper class

@Html.Partial("_NavBar");

we pass in the partial we want to call as a string

You can also pass a model along with the partial
@Html.Partial("_NavBar", Model.[property]);
