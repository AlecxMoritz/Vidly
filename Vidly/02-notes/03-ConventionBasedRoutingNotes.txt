Sometimes you want some custom kind stuff

when ever you make a new route you will first call

route.MapRoute();

You always need to make sure the most specific routes are at the top, that way a very generic route doesn't end up being applied to a very specific url,


this is the most common overload the route.MapRoute(); it takes three parameters

route.MapRute(
	"MoviesByResleaseDate", // route name
	"movies/released/{year}/{month}, // url pattern, notice only year and month are in curlies
	new { controller = "Movies", action = "ByReleaseDate",  // now we need to specify the defaults, 
			// and we'll do it with an anonymous object >> 1. define controller 2. define the method to use
	new { year = @"\d{4}", month = @"\d{2}"}); // we can also pass in contstraints, and we can user regular expressions to set the required number of digits. 
			// notice the use of verbatim strings to get arounding needing to use \\d to escape the quotes



More contstraint goodies::

you can also look have specific values in the constraints

	new { year = @"2015 | 2016", month = @"\d{2} "});
				// notice the pipe right here means 2015 OR 2016


clean and sleek way to write routes
