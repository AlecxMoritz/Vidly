Action results are the output of our actions

Action parameters are the -inputs- of our actions

When a request comes in the MVC framework automatically maps request data to paramater values for action methods.
It looks for a parameter of the same name and passes the data to the target action
The data could come from a number of PARAMETER SOURCES
	in the URL : /movies/edit/{1}
	in the query string : /movies/edit?id=1
	in the form data = : id=1

	Two Params in Query String /movies?pageIndex=2&sortBy=Date
