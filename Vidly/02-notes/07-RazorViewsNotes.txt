@{		  //(1)
    var className = Model.Customers.Count > 5 ? "popular" : null;
}

             //(1)
<h2 class="@className">@Model.Movie.Name</h2>

@if(Model.Customers.Count == 0) //(2)
{
    <p>No one has rented this movie before.</p>
} else
{
    <ul>
    @foreach (var customer in Model.Customers) //(3)
    {
        <li>@customer.Name</li>
    }
    </ul>
}
