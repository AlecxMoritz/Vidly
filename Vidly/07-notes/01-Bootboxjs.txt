BootboxJs

Bootbox is a useful jQuery plugin for creating nicer looking 'alert' boxes using Bootstrap modals, with less code

We insteall bootbox using the package-manager console, then us it in our javascript

$("#customers").on("click", ".js-delete", function () {
                var button = $(this);
                bootbox.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this customer?", function (result) {
                    if (result) {
                        $.ajax({
                            url: "/api/customers/" + button.attr("data-customer-id"),
                            method: "DELETE",
                            success: function () {
                                table.row(button.parents("tr")).remove().draw();
                            }
                        });
                    }
                });
            });

usually we attach a class, and an class to our table so we can use it more easily. And we put a class on our button so we can use this more easily as well.

So in this example, our table has an ID of "customers", and our button has a class of 'js-delete'.
